Teachers can start games that students may then join through the website using a code.
As the students play the teacher is able to see the scores of each student. They are also able to access a report with detailed information about the performance of individual players.

The website requires no log-in and uses cookies to store persistent data identifying games owned. Each game has an unique hash though which one may access the game from another computer.
